        <p>
            👉 A.P.J Abdul Kalam, in full Avul Pakir Jainulbdeen Abdul Kalam, was born on October 15, 1931 in Rameshwaran, Tamil Nadu, India.<br><br>
            ☛ He served as the 11th President
            of India from 2002 to 2007.<br><br>
            ☛ Kalam earned a degree in
            aeronautical engineering from the
            Madras Institute of Technology and in
            1958 joined the Defence Research and
            Development Organisation (DRDO).<br><br>
            ☛ In 1969, he moved to the Indian
            Space Research Organisation, where he
            was project director of the SLV-III, the
            first satellite launch vehicle that was
            both designed and produced in India.
            <br><br> ☛ Rejoining DRDO in 1982,
            Kalam planned the program that produced
            a number of successful missiles, which
            helped earn him the nickname <strong>
            “Missile Man.”</strong>
            <br><br> ☛ Among those successes
            was Agni, India’s first intermediate-range
            ballistic missile, which incorporated
            aspects of the SLV-III and was launched
            in 1989.
            <br><br> ☛ He also played a
            pivotal organisational, technical,
            and political role in India's Pokhran-II
            nuclear tests in 1998, the first since
            the original nuclear test by India in 1974.
            <br><br> ☛ From 1992 to 1997 Kalam
            was scientific adviser to the defense
            minister, and he later served as principal
            scientific adviser (1999–2001) to the
            government with the rank of cabinet minister.
            <br><br> ☛ His prominent role in
            the country’s 1998 nuclear weapons tests
            solidified India as a nuclear power and
            established Kalam as a national hero,
            although the tests caused great concern
            in the international community.
            <br><br> ☛ In 1998 Kalam put
            forward a countrywide plan called
            Technology Vision 2020, which he described
            as a road map for transforming India from
            a less-developed to a developed society
            in 20 years. The plan called for, among
            other measures, increasing agricultural
            productivity, emphasizing technology as
            a vehicle for economic growth, and
            widening access to health care and
            education.
            <br><br> ☛ Kalam received <b>7</b>
            honorary doctorates from <b>40</b>
            universities. The Government of India
            honoured him with the <b>Padma Bhushan
                in 1981</b> and the <b>Padma Vibhushan
            in 1990</b> for his work with ISRO and
            DRDO and his role as a scientific advisor
            to the Government.
            <br><br> ☛ In 1997, Kalam received
            India's highest civilian honour, the
            Bharat Ratna, for his contribution to
            the scientific research and modernisation
            of defence technology in India.
            <br><br> ☛ In 2013, he was the
            recipient of the Von Braun Award from
            the National Space Society "to recognize
            excellence in the management and leadership
            of a space-related project".
            <br><br> ☛ While delivering a
            lecture at the Indian Institute of
            Management Shillong, Kalam collapsed and
            died from an apparent cardiac arrest on
            <b>27 July 2015</b>, aged 83.
            <br><br> ☛ Wheeler Island, a
            national missile test site in Odisha, was
            renamed <b>Kalam Island</b> in September
            2015.
            <br><br> ☛ A prominent road in
            New Delhi was renamed from Aurangzeb
            Road to <b>Dr APJ Abdul Kalam Road</b>
            in August 2015.
            <br><br> ☛ In February 2018,
            scientists from the Botanical Survey
            of India named a newly found plant
            species as Drypetes kalamii, in his
            honour.
